    <h1>{{ "The Journey of Jade001: 青灰玉碗 or 'Grayish-Green Jade Bowl" | uppercase }}</h1>
	<p>"The ultimate goal of this project is to visually map the 'journies' or movements
	of about 150 extant Jade objects across time and space. Additionally, each Jade object has
	a multitude of texts published about each, including, but not limited to: the poems incised on 
	the Jade objects themselves, poems and essays in the officially published 'Imperial Poems'
	(御製詩), and another historical source titled 'Illustrated Records of the Imperial Emperor 
	and Western Regions' (欽定皇輿西域圖志) in various volumes even after Emperor Qianlong's Reign.
	For this project, we will be drawing text analysis from the incised object's poems, the Imperial 
	Poems, and supplemented by the 欽定皇輿西域圖志. Comparing the published printed text and the 
	inscribed text reveals that they are not identical, and the same text could be inscribed onto
	multiple objects from different places around the Islamic world. </p>
