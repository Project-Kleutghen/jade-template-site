“The Chinese Emperor’s Hindustan Jades” integrates text analysis, mapping, and interactive image
 viewers to visualize eighteenth-century China’s engagement with the Islamic world. The textual
 dataset is a group of approximately one hundred poems that the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-1795) 
 wrote about and ordered incised into the Islamic jades in his collection. The image/object dataset 
 is the group of extant inscribed jades. Comparing the published printed text and the inscribed text
 reveals that they are not identical, and the same text could be inscribed onto multiple objects 
 from different places around the Islamic world. The bilingual textual analysis and object-centered 
 stylistic comparisons will be presented in a map and embedded image viewer that combines methodology 
 from historical GIS and digital art history, with an emphasis on open source tools and open access 
 scholarship. At this stage of the project, both Sarah and Gloria are learning Python: Sarah will use it
 for Chinese textual analysis and comparison, while Gloria will use it together with the Folium library
 to create maps in Leaflet. Professor Kleutghen is focusing on image presentation with IIIF, which 
 integrates with Leaflet and allows image annotations that will be drawn from the text analysis.
